RWeka is an [R interface to Weka](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWeka/index.html) (Version 3.9.3). Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks written in Java, containing tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. Package 'RWeka' contains the interface code, the Weka jar is in a separate package 'RWekajars'. For more information on Weka see <http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/>.

[This page](https://www.r-statistics.com/2012/08/how-to-load-the-rjava-package-after-the-error-java_home-cannot-be-determined-from-the-registry/) allowed me to troubleshoot downloading the RWeka package (required the 64-bit version of Java).

```{r}
#install.packages("RWeka")
#install.packages("rJava")
library(RWeka)
```
